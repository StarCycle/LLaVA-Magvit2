# 🌟 LLaVA MagVit2: Combines MLLM Understanding and Generation with MagVit2

## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **LLaVA MagVit2** project! This repository combines the power of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) with the advanced capabilities of MagVit2 for image understanding and generation. Our main goal is to leverage the Image tokenizer inside LLava to enhance both the comprehension and creation of images, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field of computer vision and natural language processing.

> ⚠️👷 the repo is currently at early stage, combining Image understanding and Generation is a good exporation on Multi Modal LLMs. Our ultimate goal is to make it a mini GPT4o with vision and voice ability.

## 🏆 Results

Our approach is to yielded impressive results in various benchmarks and applications. Here are some possiable highlights:

- **Image Understanding**: Achiev state-of-the-art performance in image classification and object detection tasks.
- **Image Generation**: Generat high-quality images from textual descriptions with remarkable fidelity and diversity.
- **Multimodal Tasks**: Successfully integrat image and text modalities to perform complex tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning.
